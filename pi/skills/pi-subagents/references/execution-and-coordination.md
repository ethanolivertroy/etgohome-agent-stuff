# Execution modes and coordination

Read when using parallel runs, chains, saved-file output, the clarify TUI, worktree isolation, oracle advice, intercom coordination, or runtime diagnostics.

## Running subagents

### Parallel execution

```typescript
subagent({
  tasks: [
    { agent: "scout", task: "Explore the auth module" },
    { agent: "reviewer", task: "Review the API client" }
  ]
})
```

Top-level parallel tasks can override per-task behavior:

```typescript
subagent({
  tasks: [
    { agent: "scout", task: "Map auth", output: "auth-context.md", progress: true },
    { agent: "researcher", task: "Research OAuth best practices", output: "oauth-research.md" },
    { agent: "reviewer", task: "Review auth tests", model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4" }
  ],
  concurrency: 3
})
```

Avoid duplicate output paths in parallel tasks. Concurrent children should not write to the same file. For large saved outputs, set `outputMode: "file-only"` together with an `output` path. The parent result then contains only a compact reference like `Output saved to: /abs/report.md (48.2 KB, 2847 lines). Read this file if needed.` instead of the full saved content. Do not use `output: false` for this; `output: false` means no file output. Failed runs and save errors still return inline details for debugging.

### Chain execution

```typescript
subagent({
  chain: [
    { agent: "scout", task: "Map the auth flow and summarize key files" },
    { agent: "planner", task: "Create an implementation plan from {previous}" },
    { agent: "worker", task: "Implement the approved plan based on {previous}" }
  ]
})
```

Chain steps can use templated variables such as `{task}`, `{previous}`, and
`{chain_dir}`. This is the main way to pass structured summaries between steps
without forcing each step to rediscover everything.

## Clarify TUI

Single and parallel runs support a clarification TUI when you want to preview or
edit parameters before launch:

```typescript
subagent({
  agent: "worker",
  task: "Implement feature X",
  clarify: true
})
```

Chains default to clarify mode; set `clarify: false` to skip it. Clarify edits affect only the next run; use management actions, settings, or markdown files for persistent changes.
For programmatic background launches, use `async: true`. Set `clarify: false` when you want to bypass chain clarification explicitly; `clarify: true` keeps the run foreground for the clarify UI.


## Worktree Isolation

When multiple agents might write concurrently, use worktrees instead of letting
them share one filesystem view.

```typescript
subagent({
  tasks: [
    { agent: "worker", task: "Implement feature A" },
    { agent: "worker", task: "Implement feature B" }
  ],
  worktree: true
})
```

`worktree: true` gives each parallel task its own git worktree branched from
HEAD. This requires a clean git state and is mainly for intentionally parallel
write workflows. If you want one writer thread and several advisory agents,
prefer a single-writer pattern instead.

## The Oracle Workflow

The intended oracle loop is:
1. the main agent forks to `oracle`
2. `oracle` reviews direction, drift, assumptions, and risks
3. `oracle` can coordinate back through `contact_supervisor` when the bridge injects it
4. the main agent decides what direction to approve
5. only then should `worker` implement

```typescript
// Advisory review in a branched thread. Oracle defaults to forked context.
subagent({
  agent: "oracle",
  task: "Review my current direction, challenge assumptions, and propose the best next move."
})

// Implementation only after explicit approval. Worker defaults to forked context.
subagent({
  agent: "worker",
  task: "Implement the approved approach: ..."
})
```

`oracle` is not a fresh-context reviewer in the Cognition article sense. It is
a forked advisory thread that inherits the parent session history and uses that
history as a baseline contract.

Use `oracle` as a smart-friend escalation when the parent needs help with trajectory rather than diff inspection: architectural boundaries, model capability routing, merge conflicts, reviewer disagreement, context drift after long work, a worker about to invent a pattern, or fixes that require product/scope tradeoffs. Ask broad questions when the right concern is unclear, and let `oracle` point out missing context or files the parent should inspect before asking again. Keep `oracle` advisory unless it has been explicitly assigned the single writer role.

## Subagent + Intercom Coordination

`pi-subagents` works without `pi-intercom`. When `pi-intercom` is installed and enabled, the intercom bridge can automatically give child agents a private coordination channel back to the parent session.

Most agents should not call generic `intercom` directly unless bridge instructions provide a target and `contact_supervisor` is unavailable. Do not invent a target. Prefer the tool from the injected bridge instructions.

Use `contact_supervisor` with `reason: "need_decision"` when:
- a subagent is blocked on a decision
- a child needs clarification instead of guessing
- an approval, product, API, or scope choice is required before continuing safely

Do not use `contact_supervisor` just to resolve review-only/no-edit versus progress-writing or artifact-writing instructions. No-edit wins, and the child should return review findings without touching files.

Use `contact_supervisor` with `reason: "progress_update"` when:
- a child is explicitly asked for progress
- a meaningful discovery changes the plan
- a long-running child needs to report a blocked/progress checkpoint without waiting for normal tool return flow

Message conventions:
- `reason: "need_decision"` waits for the parent reply and returns it to the child.
- `reason: "progress_update"` is non-blocking and should stay concise.
- Child-side routine completion handoffs are not expected. With the intercom bridge active, parent-side `pi-subagents` sends grouped completion results through `pi-intercom`: one grouped message per foreground parent run and one per completed async result file. Acknowledged foreground delivery returns a compact receipt with artifact/session paths; if unacknowledged, the normal full output is preserved. Grouped messages include child intercom targets and full child summaries.

If bridge instructions provide the child-facing tool, a child can ask:

```typescript
contact_supervisor({
  reason: "need_decision",
  message: "Should I optimize for readability or performance here?"
})
```

The parent replies with:

```typescript
intercom({ action: "reply", message: "Optimize for readability." })
```

Or inspects unresolved asks first:

```typescript
intercom({ action: "pending" })
```

If intercom messages do not show up, run `subagent({ action: "doctor" })` or `/subagents-doctor`.

## Error Handling

**"Unknown agent"**
```typescript
subagent({ action: "list" })
// Check available agents and chains, then confirm scope/precedence.
```

**Setup, discovery, or intercom confusion**
```typescript
subagent({ action: "doctor" })
// Check runtime paths, async support, discovery counts, current session, and intercom bridge state.
```

**"Max subagent depth exceeded"**
```typescript
// Flatten the workflow or raise maxSubagentDepth in config.
```

**"Session manager did not return a session file"**
```typescript
// Persist the current session before using context: "fork".
```

**Intercom "Already waiting for a reply"**
```typescript
// Resolve the current outbound ask before starting another one.
```

**Parallel output-path conflict**
```typescript
// Give each parallel task a distinct output path, or disable output for tasks that do not need it.
```

**Worktree launch fails**
```typescript
// Ensure the git working tree is clean and task cwd overrides match the shared cwd.
```

**Child fails before starting**
```typescript
// Inspect `subagent({ action: "status", id: "..." })`, artifact metadata/output logs, and run doctor. Extension loader errors usually appear in child output logs.
```
